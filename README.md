# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

For this project, I worked with a travel application, PlanMyTripp, to write code assisting users in trip planning. The main focus of the code is to allow travelers to filter their potential travel destinations using pereferred weather conditions. Once a destination is chosen, the app allows users to find hotels in the city that matches their preferences and gives directions to other nearby cities.
